a **"Sniff"** is a single PHP class that checks one specific coding rule.

```php
function hello_world() {
echo "Hi"; // Sniff error: Line indented incorrectly; expected 4 spaces, found 0.
}
```

- File named **`phpcs.xml`** or **`phpcs.xml.dist`** is used for custom coding standards.
- This file lives in your project's root directory. phpcs automatically looks for it.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset name="MyProjectStandard">
    <description>My custom ruleset.</description>

    <rule ref="WordPress-VIP"/>

    <rule ref="PHPCompatibilityWP"/>
    <config name="testVersion" value="8.2"/>

    <exclude-pattern>*/vendor/*</exclude-pattern>
</ruleset>
```


- To ignore specific error codes or standards:
	- **In the `phpcs.xml` file:** You can tell PHPCS to use a standard but "exclude" a specific sniff that you don't like.
	- **In the Code (Inline):** If you have a specific line of code that _must_ break a rule for a good reason, you use comments:
    ```php
    // phpcs:ignore Standard.Category.SniffName -- reason for ignoring
    $variable = 'this line will be ignored';
    
    // phpcs:disable -- disables everything until the enable tag
    $some_bad_code = true;
    // phpcs:enable
    ```

- **PHPCBF** (PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer) installs automatically and fixes violations.
**Command:** `phpcbf /path/to/code`

`phpcs -i` shows which rulesets currently being used

To check a file using a standard `phpcs --standard=WordPress-VIP path/to/file.php`
