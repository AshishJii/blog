- WP-CLI is a PHP-based tool that interacts with your WordPress files and database. It bypasses the web browser, making it significantly faster for repetitive tasks and bulk operations.

|**Task**|**Command**|
|---|---|
|List all plugins|`wp plugin list`|
|Install & Activate|`wp plugin install contact-form-7 --activate`|
|Update all plugins|`wp plugin update --all`|
|Deactivate a plugin|`wp plugin deactivate akismet`|
- **Export DB:** `wp db export` (creates a `.sql` file instantly)
- **Import DB:** `wp db import file.sql`

- Local WP even lets you use custom domain names with the ‘.local’ top-level domain. For instance, if your project is named ‘example,’ you can access it through ‘example.local’ in your web browser.
- Local WP achieves this by adding entries to your local host files that direct to your computer’s IP address (localhost). It also adjusts or removes these entries when you delete a project.
- **HSTS – HTTP Strict Transport Security** is a security policy mechanism that helps websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks (HTTP) and cookie hijacking. Basically it allows the web servers to declare that web browsers should interact with the servers only using the HTTPS (secured) connection. Web servers implementing HSTS policy supply the header (HSTS headers over HTTP are ignored) over a HTTPS connection.

- Nginx is usually faster than Apache. For this reason, they are sometimes used together, with Nginx as a front-end proxy.
- Browser engines:
	1. [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_\(browser_engine\)) — used by Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Electron-based desktop apps such as Slack, VS Code, etc. It was forked by WebKit
	2. [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_\(software\)) (-moz-) – used by Mozilla Firefox
	3. [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) (-webkit-) — used by Apple Safari
- user ➞  browser ➞ internet ➞ web server ➞ application server (WordPress) ➞  php ➞ mysql

- [SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://www.socketlabs.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) and it’s the industry standard protocol for email sending.
- IMAP (Internet Access Message Protocol) is an email protocol that deals with managing and retrieving email messages from the receiving server.

- WordPress out of the box sends emails using PHP’s mail function. PHP in turn by default uses [Sendmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail).

- The flow usually looks like this:
WordPress wp_mail() ➞ PHP mail() ➞ OS sendmail
