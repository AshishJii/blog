Hi, I’m Ashish. This is my blog, where I:

- Document my journey in coding, security, and projects
- Share writeups of CTF challenges, experiments, and bypasses
- Explain technical concepts like TOTP, credit card verification, and system internals
- Record my projects, and everything else

This is a space to learn, reflect, and maybe help someone along the way.  
Posts range from mini-experiments to full project deep dives.  

Welcome!
